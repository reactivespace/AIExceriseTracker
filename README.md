AI Exercise Tracker
 

The purpose of Building an Artificial Intelligence powered Application to connect users with one of the most sought after pastimes in the form of Exercise was the goal of AI Exercise Tracker. Built on Core ML framework for its AI functions and Native + Swift Technologies to support the development on iOS devices, the AI Exercise tracker has been Modified for custom workouts catering to the needs of multiple users. 
 

A brief scenario on how this application works needs to be shared to explain the concept behind this idea. An image of the user is taken by the camera built in the device using the app. Standardized skeletal points of the body such as the joints of the shoulders, joints of the elbows etc are taken of every image and a structural form is built based on the movement of the user. This movement is compared with the movement of the exercise video that is being replicated by the user. The exercise video will already have the skeletal points moving in a set direction so the application can compare the movement of the user in comparison with the movement in the video. Repeated actions or in Exercise Jargon, “Reps” of similar actions can also be counted using this app giving it the functionality of following set workout plans.
 

Even though the application can follow multiple exercises, the one used in the beta version of the AI Exercise Tracker is “Jumping Jacks”. Since this exercise utilizes one’s body weight, no external requirements are needed and it can be performed anywhere and anytime. It is a great cardiovascular exercise that increases muscle strength,endurance and burns calories. The video is taken from Fitness Blenders ‘Jumping Jacks’ video on Youtube. It showcases the perfect technique and form users must have to perform Jumping Jacks and this will be used to gauge how well users can match their exercise in a similar fashion.

Other exercise and fitness videos can also be added to this application as per the individuals requirements. Skeletal points can be made for routines such as ‘Pushups’, ‘Squats’, ‘Crunches’ and more for a good routine. The app negates the need for real life trainers to be present and thus can be used anywhere. It is a great asset to have for fitness enthusiasts and gyms that can provide a value added service to users that cannot commute to the gym or hire personal trainers to guide them. With Artificial Intelligence leading the race, this idea can revolutionize a concept that 30% of the global population partakes in at least once a week.
